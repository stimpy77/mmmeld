# mmmeld

**A multimedia video generator that combines audio, images, and video into cohesive multimedia presentations.**

mmmeld is a powerful tool for creating videos from various media sources, with support for text-to-speech, audio processing, image manipulation, and video composition. Perfect for content creators, educators, and developers who need to automate video generation workflows.

## 🚀 Current Implementation

The primary, actively maintained implementation of mmmeld is written in **Go** and located in the `mmmeld-go/` directory.

**👉 [Go to mmmeld-go documentation](./mmmeld-go/)**

### Why Go?

The Go implementation offers:
- **Better performance** - Faster processing and lower memory footprint
- **Easier distribution** - Single binary with no runtime dependencies
- **Cross-platform** - Native builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Improved maintainability** - Stronger typing and modern tooling

## 📦 Installation
